    <h3>Allergies</h3> <br>
    <p>Allergies are an immune response triggered by allergens, an ordinarily harmful substance.</p> <br><br>

    <h3>Causes</h3> <br> 

    <p>People with allergies have especially sensitive immune systems that react when they contact allergens. <br>

        Common allergens include: <br>
        <div class="allergens">
        <ul>
            <li>foods (nuts, eggs, milk, soy, shellfish, wheat)</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li> pollen</li>
        </ul>
        
        <ul>
            <li>mold</li>
        </ul>
        
        <ul>
            <li>  latex</li>
        </ul>
        
        <ul>
            <li>pet dander</li>
        </ul>
      
        </p>
       
    </div><br>

    <h3>Symptoms</h3> <br>
    <p>Because there are so many possible causes, the symptoms of allergies vary widely. Airborne allergens, like pollen and pet dander, are likely to cause: <br>
    
        <div class="syptopms">
        <ul>
            <li>Eye irritation</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Runny nose</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Stuffy nose</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li> Puffy, watery eyes</li>
    </ul>
        
    <ul>
        <li>Sneezing</li>
    </ul>
        
    <ul>
        <li>Inflamed, itchy nose and throat</li>
    </ul>
        
    
    </p>
    </div> <br>

    <h3>Prevention</h3> <br>
    <p>UHS offers flu shots to Princeton students at a reduced cost every fall. Even though getting a flu shot will not <br> completely eliminate your chances of developing the flu, it will certainly reduce the risk. Each year, a new vaccine <br> made from inactivated (killed) influenza viruses is formulated. Since it may take the immune system time to respond <br> to the vaccination, the inactivated vaccine should be given 6 to 8 weeks before flu season begins in order to prevent <br> infection or reduce the severity of the illness.

        The flu is probably only contagious during the first three days of illness, <br> and the incubation period is 24-72 hours, meaning you might not show symptoms for three days after contracting the virus. <br> It is rare to catch a cold virus through the air – most transmission occurs via hand-to-hand contact. To prevent colds, flu, and <br> other illnesses, follow these tips:</p>

        <div class="prevention">
        <ul>
            <li> Wash your hands often (which is good advice for keeping healthy in any situation). <br> Keep them away from your nose, eyes, and mouth. Use an instant hand sanitizer when you can’t wash your hands.</li>
        </ul>
       
        <ul>
            <li>Get regular exercise and eat well.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Follow good sleep habits.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <ul>
            <li> Get a flu shot each fall (offered to all students at a lower cost by UHS each fall) </li>
        </ul>
    </div> <br>

    <h3>Cold and Flu</h3> <br>
    <p>Colds and influenza (flu) are the most common illnesses among college students. </p> <br>

    <h3>Causes</h3> <br>
    <p>Both of these illnesses are upper respiratory infections, meaning they involve your nose, throat, and lungs. <br> Viruses cause both colds and flu by increasing inflammation of the membranes in the nose and throat.

       <br> Most transmission of these viruses occurs via hand-to-hand contact.</p> <br>
        
      <h3>Symptoms</h3><br>
      <p>Flu symptoms come on suddenly and affect the body all over. Flu symptoms are usually more serious than a cold and include:

       
<div class="symptoms-ol">
        <ul>
            <li>fever (100° F),</li>
            <li>headache</li>
            <li>more intense pain and fatigue</li>
            <li>more severe, often dry cough.</li>
        </ul> <br>
        <p>You may also experience a mild headache, body aches or a low grade fever. Typically, a cold lasts 2-14 days.</p>

    <h3>Conjunctivitis (“pink eye“)</h3> <br>
    <p>Conjunctivitis, or pink eye, is an irritation or inflammation of the conjunctiva, which covers the white part of the eyeball.</p> <br>

    <h3>Causes</h3> <br>
    <p>Conjunctivitis, an inflammation of the transparent membrane (conjunctiva) that lines your eyelids and part of your eyeballs, <br> has several possible causes. It could be a bacterial or viral infection, an allergic reaction to pollen or animal dander, or a result <br> of chemical irritants (smoke, chlorine, lens solution, etc.).</p>
    
    </p> <br>

    <h3>Symptoms</h3> <br>
    <p>These symptoms may last a few hours to several weeks: redness, itching, tearing, burning sensation, pus-like discharge and/or <br> crusting of the eyelids. Because conjunctivitis causes inflammation of the small blood vessels in the conjunctiva to become more <br> prominent, the whites of your eyes will appear pink or red. When you wake you are likely to feel that your eyelids are pasted shut, <br> and your vision may not be as clear as usual.</p>

  <br>  <h3>Prevention</h3><br>
    <p>Pink eye is extremely contagious, so if you know someone who is infected, make sure you do not expose yourself to contact with <br> the person’s eye fluid. The infection can easily be passed via keyboards, doorknobs, make-up, pens, gym equipment, and a vast <br> number of other items. To protect yourself, wash your hands frequently, avoid touching your eyes, and wash anything that may be contaminated.</p>
